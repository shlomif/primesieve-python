Python bindings for the [primesieve](http://primesieve.org/) C++
library.

Generates primes orders of magnitude faster than any pure Python code!

**Features:**

* Get a list of primes
* Iterate over primes using little memory
* Find the nth prime
* Count/print primes and [prime k-tuplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_k-tuple)
* Multi-threaded for counting primes and finding the nth prime
* NumPy support

Motivation
----------

I enjoy algorithm problems such as those in
[Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam) and
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Many pertain to number
theory. It's important (and fun) to write your own prime finding code
once, but it's also useful to have a fast, reliable library.

Two of my favourite problems: Google Code Jam
[Expensive Dinner](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/dashboard?c=1150486#s=p2)
and Project Euler [Problem 500](https://projecteuler.net/problem=500)

Prerequisites
------------
You need to have installed a C++ compiler on all OSes except Windows.

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt-get install g++ python-dev

# macOS: first install Xcode using App Store
xcode-select --install
```

Installation
------------
```
pip install primesieve
````

Usage examples
--------------

```Python
>>> from primesieve import *

# Get a list of the primes <= 40
>>>  primes(40)
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]

# Get a list of the primes between 100 and 120
>>>  primes(100, 120)
[101, 103, 107, 109, 113]

# Get a list of the first 10 primes
>>>  n_primes(10)
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]

# Get a list of the first 10 primes >= 1000
>>>  n_primes(10, 1000)
[1009, 1013, 1019, 1021, 1031, 1033, 1039, 1049, 1051, 1061]

# Get the 10th prime
>>> nth_prime(10)
29

# Count the primes below 10**9
>>> count_primes(10**9)
50847534
```

Here is a [list of all available functions](primesieve/_primesieve.pyx).

Iterating over primes
---------------------

Instead of generating a large list of primes and then do something
with the primes it is also possible to simply iterate over the primes
which uses less memory.

```Python
>>> import primesieve

it = primesieve.Iterator()
prime = it.next_prime()

# Iterate over the primes below 10000
while prime < 10000:
    print prime
    prime = it.next_prime()

# Set iterator start number to 100
it.skipto(100)
prime = it.prev_prime()

# Iterate backwards over the primes below 100
while prime > 0:
    print prime
    prime = it.prev_prime()
```

NumPy support
-------------
Using the ```primesieve.numpy``` module you can generate an array of
primes using **native C++ performance!**

In comparison the ```primesieve``` module generates a list of primes
about 7 times slower mostly because the conversion of the C++ primes
array into a python list is very slow.

```Python
>>> from primesieve.numpy import *

# Generate a numpy array with the primes below 100
>>>  primes(100)
array([ 2,  3,  5,  7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59,
       61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97])

# Generate a numpy array with the first 100 primes
>>>  n_primes(100)
array([  2,   3,   5,   7,  11,  13,  17,  19,  23,  29,  31,  37,  41,
        43,  47,  53,  59,  61,  67,  71,  73,  79,  83,  89,  97, 101,
       103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167,
       173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239,
       241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313,
       317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397,
       401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467,
       479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541])
```

Development
-----------

You need to have installed a C++ compiler, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```bash
# Install prerequisites
pip install cython pytest numpy

# Clone repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hickford/primesieve-python

cd primesieve-python

# Build and install primesieve-python
pip install . --upgrade

# Run tests
py.test
```

#### Mac OS X and OpenMP

It isn't that hard to get parallel process support working on MacOSX. You'll need to install the clang compiler that supports OpenMP. Instead of the pip install step above, do the following steps.

```bash

# get the clang compiler with OpenMP support 
brew install clang-omp

# build the package using clang compilers with OpenMP support
CXX=/usr/local/bin/clang-omp CC=/usr/local/bin/clang-omp pip install . --upgrade

# test the primesieve library uses multiple cores.
# run this and check Activity Monitor for multiple threads
python -c 'import primesieve as ps; n=ps.parallel_count_primes(10**10); print(n)'
455052511
